					<h1>Introduction</h1>
					<p>
						Alzheimer’s is based off of two clusters: plaques and tangles. 
						<br>
					</p>
					<p style="font-weight: bold;">
						- Plaques are clusters of beta-amyloid peptides.<br>
						- Tangles are groups of tau protein after a microtububle has been killed.<br>
						- Removing the beta-secretase enzyme will prevent the beta-amyloid peptides from forming.<br>

					</p>
					<br><br>
					<h1>What is a Plaque?</h1>
					<p>
						Plaques are a combination of many <a href="glossary.html#beta-amyloid-peptide" class="define">beta-amyloid peptides</a>. These peptides are made from a series of cuts into the <a href="amyloid-protein-precursor" class="define">Amyloid Protein Precursor</a> (APP). APP proteins are <a href="glossary.html#transmembrane" class="define">transmembrane</a> proteins, meaning that they pass through the <a href="glossary.html#cell-membrane" class="define">cell membrane</a>. The APP is a very important part of the neuron. It is found on the synapses, and helps with growing the cell as well as repairing it. For the beta-amyloid peptide to be released, the APP must be cut at two locations by two special enzymes: the beta secretase, which cuts the APP outside the cell membrane, and the gamma secretase which is on the inside of the cell membrane. (Refer to the images for a visual representation). These beta-amyloid peptides are very chemically sticky. The beta amyloids are usually cleared by the body. In the case of Alzheimer’s disease however, there is an imbalance. The amyloid beta protein is no longer regulated meaning the quantity of it is too great. They will float around and stick to other beta-amyloid peptides making indesirable fibrels and create <a href="glossary.html#senile-plaques" class="define">senile plaques</a>. These plaques float around and disrupt cell communications, which causes these brain cells to trigger <a href="glossary.html#inflammation" class="define">inflammation</a>. This usually ends with the brain cell dying.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<h1>What is a Tangle?</h1>
					<p>
						Scientists believe that tangles are a consequence of <a href="glossary.html#beta-amyloid-plaque" class="define">beta-amyloid plaques</a>. Although we have not yet discovered how this happens, scientists have concluded that beta-amyloid plaques may be the cause of some sort of signal for the tau protein to malfunction. When neurons communicate with each other, a signal goes from the body known as <a href="soma" class="define">soma</a> to the <a href="glossary.html#synapse" class="define">synapse</a> to transfer the information. The signal passes through the skeleton of the neuron composed of <a href="microtubule" class="define">microtubules</a>, which are stabilized by normal tau proteins. In Alzheimer's disease, these tau proteins are abnormally <a href="glossary.html#hyperphosphorylated" class="define">hyperphosphorylated</a>. This hyperphosphorylation process makes the tau protein inactive. This causes the microtubule to lose its structural integrity and begins to collapse. The leftover hyperphosphorylated tau proteins begin sticking to each other, and create large tangles. These tangles then disrupt communications between neurons, causing them to trigger <a href="glossary.html#inflammation" class="define">inflammation</a>, and leaving the cell to die. When the cell dies it creates a <a href="glossary.html#neurofibrillary-tangle" class="define">neurofibrillary tangle</a> with its remains and tau protein. While the process of hyperphosphorylation is occurring, mutated tau proteins can travel through the synapse arriving to other healthy neurons around the neurofibrillary tangle. Once they arrive they are able to reduplicate the process of hyperphosphorylation in the healthy neuron. This would occur progressively to the neurons surrounding the neurofibrillary tangle to create more until it reaches the whole brain, making some sort of exponential growth.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<h1>The Solution</h1>
					<p>
						Our solution needs to solve both of these problems, <a href="glossary.html#beta-amyloid-plaque" class="define">plaques</a> and <a href="glossary.html#neurofibrillary-tangle" class="define">tangles</a>. Luckily, the tangles are believed to be formed from the plaques, meaning that if we eliminate the plaques, there will be no tangles. Plaques are made from <a href="glossary.html#beta-amyloid-peptide" class="define">beta-amyloid peptides</a>, which are made from two enzymes cutting the <a href="glossary.html#amyloid-protein-precursor" class="define">APP</a> protein. If we eliminate the cutting process, then there cannot be any peptides. Generally, the gamma secretase is the first enzyme to cut, which is a standard part of the brain’s maintenance. The problem comes when the beta-secretase comes and cuts a second time. If we make the APP protein resilient to the beta-secretase, then there will not be any beta-amyloid peptides. We can manufacture a vaccine that will introduce a small amount of beta-secretase enzymes to the brain cells. The APP proteins will get cut, but then grow back more resilient to these cuts. Later when the enzymes try to cut a second time, they will not be able to.

					<h1>Prevention</h1>
					<p>
						Some ways to prevent Alzheimer's are:<br>
						 - Stopping consumption of cigarettes and keeping alchohol to a minimum.<br>
						 - Have a balanced diet.<br>
						 - Excercising at least 150 minutes per week.<br>
						 - Keeping regular health checkups.<br>
						 - Staying mentally and socially active.<br>
						 - Reading and learning new languages.<br>
						 - Playing musical instruments.<br>
						 - Taking part in group activities/sports.<br>
						 - Maintaining a social life.<br>
